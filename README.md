### Description

This is just a script from a simple phone book. I used this script to mention the phone numbers and emails from each department where I worked. For all developers to be able to view the list, I made a group policy on my AD server on windows server.

#### To make the group policy:

The experience of the users with this list in their respective workspaces was excellent, as well as the ease of consulting the numbers, the ease of clicking on the user's email and opening the default email client of the machine (eg Outlook) was easy and fast. It was no longer necessary to call from department to department or from company reception asking about employee emails and hearing cost reduction on paper, because before the list was made in excel and printed for employees.

Note: This script is only for small / medium agencies. For large-scale companies, I recommend something done in a database and a dashboard for maintenance.
